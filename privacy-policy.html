                    You may have heard of "cookies," which are small files or pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit a web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most web sites. <span>MAGURA GROUP</span>  Foods Ltd. may use cookies to collect other information during your visit to our web sites, such as the particular site areas you visit and the activities in which you participate at our web sites. <span>MAGURA GROUP</span>  Foods Ltd. does not automatically collect any Personal Information, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (through cookies) with voluntarily submitted Personal Information. Such link may occur only if you provide <span>MAGURA GROUP</span>  Foods Ltd. with Personal Information on our sites. This practice allows <span>MAGURA GROUP</span>  Foods Ltd. to keep track of items such as sweepstakes participation, email and advertising interaction levels, survey responses, online coupon redemption and other web activity in order to better tailor our web sites and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our web sites -- the computer can remember that you have already provided Personal Information to us and not request that you provide any a second time.
